                    <b>Murphy</b> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havanese_dog">Bichon Havanais</a>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He was born November 2021 near Gothenburg, Sweden and
                    we've had him since he was around 9 weeks old. He's been chipped, vaccinated and has been going to
                    puppy training school since mid-March 2022.
                    <br>
                    As he is just a puppy, we are still trying to figure out his routine; which sometimes means some very early
                    mornings for us. However, Murphy is very well behaved.
                    He loves going for walks, playing fetch and, most of all, sleeping.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We've taken lots of photos of Murphy and this site contains some of our favorites. We hope you like
                    them just as much as we do.
