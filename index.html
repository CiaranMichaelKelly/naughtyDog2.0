    <h1>Welcome to Naughty Dog!</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Murphy</b> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havanese_dog">Bichon Havanais</a>. 
        <br>
        He was born November 2021 near Gothenburg, Sweden.
        We've had him since he was around 9 weeks old. He's been chipped, vaccinated and has been going to puppy training school since mid-March 2022.
        <br>
        Murphy is very well behaved. He loves going for walks, playing fetch and, most of all, sleeping.
