<b>Murphy</b> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havanese_dog">Bichon Havanais</a>.<br>He was born November 2021 near Gothenburg, Sweden and
We've had him since he was around 9 weeks old. He's been chipped, vaccinated and has been going to puppy training school since mid-March 2022.
<br>
As he is just a puppy, we are still figuirng out his routine; which sometimes means some very early mornings for us. However, Murphy is very well behaved. 
He loves going for walks, playing fetch and, most of all, sleeping.

We've taken lots of photos of Murphy and this site contains some of our favorite. We hope you like them just as much as we do.
